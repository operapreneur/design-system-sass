# Elements Directory

> An HTML Element is the most basic Functional Pattern in a Design System.

The types of HTML elements included at this level are simple Functional Patterns that cannot be broken into smaller parts. In other words, they should not include any child elements.


## Hierarchy
The HTML spec organizes HTML elements in "zero or more" content categories — the categories group elements that share common characteristics. Since each group can sometimes share common characteristics the organization of this directory is flexible & based on basic semantics.

## Atomic Design
This Design System structure has also been influenced by the Brad Frost's Atomic Design book. If using Atomic Design as a methodology for creating a Design System, this directory would be referred to as Atoms.

Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, an input or a button.

Atoms can also include more abstract elements like color palettes, fonts and even more invisible aspects of an interface like animations.

Like atoms in nature they’re fairly abstract and often not terribly useful on their own. However, they’re good as a reference in the context of a pattern library as you can see all your global styles laid out at a glance.
